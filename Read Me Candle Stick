This notebook demonstrates a refined approach to algorithmic crypto trading using custom signal filtering logic and a structured pipeline. It builds on core backtesting principles while integrating improved trade decision rules and visual analytics.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Clean and structure BTC-USD historical price data

Implement signal-based strategy (filtered with multiple logic layers)

Visualize buy/sell signals directly on price charts

Store trade history in a custom log format

Lay groundwork for future real-time or automated systems

ðŸ§  Strategy Enhancements
Signal Logic:

Uses multiple filters before generating a trade signal

Incorporates daily return calculations

Ensures non-redundant entries (one open trade at a time)

Trade Management:

Track entry and exit dates, prices, and profit

Avoid repeated buy/sell signals during holding periods

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python (Google Colab)

pandas, numpy â€“ Data manipulation

yfinance â€“ Market data sourcing

matplotlib â€“ Visualization

datetime â€“ Time-based filtering

warnings â€“ Cleaner output
