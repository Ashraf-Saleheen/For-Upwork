# 📈 Gap Fill Trading Strategy (Pine Script)

This Pine Script strategy is based on the **gap fill theory**, which aims to exploit price imbalances between consecutive trading sessions. The strategy detects **gap ups** and **gap downs** and trades in the direction of the fill—buying when price gaps down and selling short when price gaps up.

## 🔍 Strategy Logic

- **Gap Detection**:
  - A gap is identified when the current session's open differs by **at least 1%** from the previous session's close.

- **Trade Entry**:
  - **Long Entry**: If a gap **down** of ≥1% is detected → Buy
  - **Short Entry**: If a gap **up** of ≥1% is detected → Short

- **Exit Conditions**:
  - **Gap Fill Target**: Exit when price reaches the previous session's close (fills the gap)
  - **Stop-Loss**: 2% from entry in the opposite direction to limit risk
