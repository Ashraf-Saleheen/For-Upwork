Project Overview
I have tried to explore a trading strategy that combines Bloomberg Sentiment scores with price data to generate buy and sell signals. The primary objectives are:

Data Integration: Incorporate Bloomberg Sentiment scores into the trading strategy.

Signal Generation: Develop buy/sell signals based on sentiment and price data.

Backtesting: Evaluate the strategy's performance using historical data.

Visualization: Present results through comprehensive visualizations.

Contents
Experiment_Success_With_BB_Sentiment_Strategy.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Import and clean historical price and sentiment data.

Signal Generation: Create trading signals using a combination of sentiment scores and price indicators.

Backtesting: Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate strategy performance.

Visualization: Generate plots to visualize trading signals, price movements, and performance metrics.
